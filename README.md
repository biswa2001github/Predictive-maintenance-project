# Predictive-maintenance-project

This repository contains a predictive maintenance project which utilises machine learning to predict the failure of machines.
The link to the app is [here](https://predictive-maintenance-app.herokuapp.com/)

Predictive maintenance is a technique that uses data analysis tools and techniques to detect anomalies in the operation and possible defects in equipment and processes so that it is possible to fix it before the failure.

This project emphasizes to demonstrate the use of machine learning in maintenance of machines in the industry. It approaches towards using the data for predicting the chance of failure and its type using machine learning models. It uses Logistic Regression to classify the types of failures. The dataset used in this project has been obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Future Scope**: This model is a demonstration of the use of machine learning in predictive maintenance of machines. It could be improved and utilised by industries and this would significantly reduce the maintenance cost of the industries.

**Areas of Improvement**: The more data collected from real industries would help in building a better model. Further study of the data and analysis could help in better feature selection of the model.


**UPDATE** Currently facing issues with the deployed webapp due to Heroku policies.
